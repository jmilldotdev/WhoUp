# WhoUp - Reprogram Your Doomscrolling

WhoUp is an app to help you reprogram your doomscrolling triggers and catch up with your friends. Instead of scrolling your phone, broadcast that you are available for a casual call to close friends or do a quick mindful reflection instead.

The great monolith rewards you with prophecies and alien plants in your zen garden to commemorate your idle moments.
